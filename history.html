    <h2>
        Brief History of Electric power 
    </h2>

    <p>
        Thomas' Edison first electriic power plant generated 110v direct current(DC) for lightening and variable machineery in nearby buildings.But efficiency transmission of power over long distances requires high voltaes.In those days , the only way to transforn DC voltage was to use a "genset"  - a DC meter driving a DC generator. Thats two rotating machines with four windings.

    <p>
        Then Nicola Tesla invented the alternating current(AC) induction motor and transformer, with constant AC frequency, an induction motor speed cannot vary, but it is cheaper and more durable than a DC Motor.snce a transformer has no moving parts and just two windings. it is cheaper and more durable than a DC genset, so at the dawn of the 20th centuary, AC won "the war of the currents"<div class=""></div><div class=""></div>

    <p>
        But not forever, in the middle of the 20th centuaries, computers begun consuming progressively more DC power, then came the insulated-gate bipolar transformer and the voltage-source convertor. a VSC can make variable frequency AC which runs induction motros at variable speed and easily transforms DC.

        DC power computer control, and the internet are helping the power grid to accept variable renewable resources like wind and solar. And they are helping electrical distribution systems on computer in neighbourhoods, and in buldings. With local energy generation and storage, distribution systems are evolving into robust "microgrids".
